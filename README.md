# dimer_qmc
Object-oriented Python-based implementation of the Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for the Shastry-Sutherland 
in the dimer basis with an external magnetic field, based on [Wessel et al. 2018](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.98.174432). Current measurements
include energy and magnetization per dimer.
